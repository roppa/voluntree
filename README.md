Voluntree - connecting you and your friends to your community

##Connect with your community and grow

Ghandi said “the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”. Our mission is to enable communities and people to connect and grow.

##Problem

There exists a disconnect from volunteering opportunities. People want to contribute but they don’t know how. Organizations need people to contribute but don’t know where to find them. 

##Solution

Enable people to connect and contribute to their communities in many different ways. Enable organisations or individuals to start a project, get volunteers, and create benefit.

##Why VolunTree?

My friends and I volunteered at a homeless shelter to make sandwiches. The experience was priceless. I would love others to experience this and our communities to grow.

##Customer Quote

My local park was littered and in a run down state. I asked for volunteers to pick up garbage one Saturday afternoon, and what a great time we had. It is amazing what you can accomplish when you pull together.
